# Project Title

The purpose of our lab is to experience software engineering practices used in industry. Our Mission is to create a library to handle complex numbers within the categories of Basic Arithmetic Tasks, Advanced Mathematical Tasks, and Extensions. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You should have the following installed on your machine:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++12 (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- CMake (v3.16 or later)
- GitHub Account
- Catch2

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [GNU Tools](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/) - GNU compiler tools
* Any other tools ....
