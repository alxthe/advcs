Class about Data Structures and Algorithms.

All Labs done in C++ and on Replit.

KomplexKanban was our final where our team developed a C++ library that handles operations for complex imaginary numbers. Library includes fundamental arithmetic and advanced mathematical tasks, with the core structure of the library including components like Complex.h, which handles basic operations as well as specialized functions for trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic operations. Programmed extensions for iostreams that allow for complex numbers to be inputted and outputted, and created a test suite to ensure the reliability and accuracy of each operation and overloaded function. The project uses a GitHub repository to store the project code, utilizing Catch Amalgamated for testing.
